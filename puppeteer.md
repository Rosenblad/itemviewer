# Puppeteer API

### Environment Variables

Puppeteer looks for certain [environment variables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environment_variable) to aid its operations. These variables can either be set in the environment or in the [npm config](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/config).

- `HTTP_PROXY`, `HTTPS_PROXY`, `NO_PROXY` - defines HTTP proxy settings that are used to download and run Chromium.
- `PUPPETEER_SKIP_CHROMIUM_DOWNLOAD` - do not download bundled Chromium during installation step.
- `PUPPETEER_DOWNLOAD_HOST` - overwrite host part of URL that is used to download Chromium

### class: Puppeteer

  - `ignoreHTTPSErrors` <[boolean]> Whether to ignore HTTPS errors during navigation. Defaults to `false`.
  - `slowMo` <[number]> Slows down Puppeteer operations by the specified amount of milliseconds. Useful so that you can see what is going on.
- returns: <[Promise]<[Browser]>>

This methods attaches Puppeteer to an existing Chromium instance.

#### puppeteer.defaultArgs()
- returns: <[Array]<[string]>> The default flags that Chromium will be launched with.

#### puppeteer.executablePath()

#### puppeteer.launch([options])
- `options` <[Object]>  Set of configurable options to set on the browser. Can have the following fields:
  - `ignoreHTTPSErrors` <[boolean]> Whether to ignore HTTPS errors during navigation. Defaults to `false`.
  - `executablePath` <[string]> Path to a Chromium or Chrome executable to run instead of bundled Chromium. If `executablePath` is a relative path, then it is resolved relative to [current working directory](https://nodejs.org/api/process.html#process_process_cwd).

  - `env` <[Object]> Specify environment variables that will be visible to browser. Defaults to `process.env`.

### class: Browser

#### event: 'disconnected'
Emitted when puppeteer gets disconnected from the Chromium instance. This might happen because one of the following:
- Chromium is closed or crashed
- `browser.disconnect` method was called

#### event: 'targetchanged'

- <[Target]>

Emitted when a target is destroyed, for example when a page is closed.

#### browser.close()
- returns: <[Promise]>

Closes Chromium and all of its pages (if any were opened). The browser object itself is considered disposed and cannot be used anymore.

You can find the `webSocketDebuggerUrl` from `http://${host}:${port}/json/version`. Learn more about the [devtools protocol](https://chromedevtools.github.io/devtools-protocol) and the [browser endpoint](https://chromedevtools.github.io/devtools-protocol/#how-do-i-access-the-browser-target).

### class: Page

#### event: 'console'
- <[ConsoleMessage]>

Emitted when JavaScript within the page calls one of console API methods, e.g. `console.log` or `console.dir`. Also emitted if the page throws an error or a warning.

The arguments passed into `console.log` appear as arguments on the event handler.

#### page.exposeFunction(name, puppeteerFunction)
- `name` <[string]> Name of the function on the window object
- `puppeteerFunction` <[function]> Callback function which will be called in Puppeteer's context.
- returns: <[Promise]>

The method adds a function called `name` on the page's `window` object.
When called, the function executes `puppeteerFunction` in node.js and returns a [Promise] which resolves to the return value of `puppeteerFunction`.

If the `puppeteerFunction` returns a [Promise], it will be awaited.

> **NOTE** Functions installed via `page.exposeFunction` survive navigations.

An example of adding an `md5` function into the page:
```js
const puppeteer = require('puppeteer');
const crypto = require('crypto');

puppeteer.launch().then(async browser => {
  const page = await browser.newPage();
  page.on('console', msg => console.log(msg.text()));
  await page.exposeFunction('md5', text =>
    crypto.createHash('md5').update(text).digest('hex')
  );
  await page.evaluate(async () => {
    // use window.md5 to compute hashes
    const myString = 'PUPPETEER';
    const myHash = await window.md5(myString);
    console.log(`md5 of ${myString} is ${myHash}`);
  });
  await browser.close();
});
```

An example of adding a `window.readfile` function into the page:

```js
const puppeteer = require('puppeteer');
const fs = require('fs');

puppeteer.launch().then(async browser => {
  const page = await browser.newPage();
  page.on('console', msg => console.log(msg.text()));
  await page.exposeFunction('readfile', async filePath => {
    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
      fs.readFile(filePath, 'utf8', (err, text) => {
        if (err)
          reject(err);
        else
          resolve(text);
      });
    });
  });
  await page.evaluate(async () => {
    // use window.readfile to read contents of a file
    const content = await window.readfile('/etc/hosts');
    console.log(content);
  });
  await browser.close();
});

```

- returns: <[Promise]>

The extra HTTP headers will be sent with every request the page initiates.

> **NOTE** page.setExtraHTTPHeaders does not guarantee the order of headers in the outgoing requests.

#### page.setJavaScriptEnabled(enabled)
- `enabled` <[boolean]> Whether or not to enable JavaScript on the page.
- returns: <[Promise]>

> **NOTE** changing this value won't affect scripts that have already been run. It will take full effect on the next [navigation](#pagegotourl-options).

#### page.setOfflineMode(enabled)
- `enabled` <[boolean]> When `true`, enables offline mode for the page.
- returns: <[Promise]>

#### page.setRequestInterception(value)
- `value` <[boolean]> Whether to enable request interception.
- returns: <[Promise]>

Activating request interception enables `request.abort`, `request.continue` and

An example of a naïve request interceptor that aborts all image requests:
```js
const puppeteer = require('puppeteer');

puppeteer.launch().then(async browser => {
  const page = await browser.newPage();
  await page.setRequestInterception(true);
  page.on('request', interceptedRequest => {
    if (interceptedRequest.url().endsWith('.png') || interceptedRequest.url().endsWith('.jpg'))
      interceptedRequest.abort();
    else
      interceptedRequest.continue();

  await browser.close();
});
```

> **NOTE** Enabling request interception disables page caching.

#### page.setUserAgent(userAgent)

  - `hasTouch`<[boolean]> Specifies if viewport supports touch events. Defaults to `false`
  - `isLandscape` <[boolean]> Specifies if viewport is in landscape mode. Defaults to `false`.
- returns: <[Promise]>

> **NOTE** in certain cases, setting viewport will reload the page in order to set the `isMobile` or `hasTouch` properties.

In the case of multiple pages in a single browser, each page can have its own viewport size.

#### page.target()
- returns: <[Target]> a target this page was created from.

#### page.viewport()
- returns: <[Object]>
  - `width` <[number]> page width in pixels.
  - `height` <[number]> page height in pixels.
  - `deviceScaleFactor` <[number]> Specify device scale factor (can be though of as dpr). Defaults to `1`.

- `options` <[Object]> Optional waiting parameters
- `...args` <...[Serializable]|[JSHandle]> Arguments to pass to  `pageFunction`
- returns: <[Promise]<[JSHandle]>> Promise which resolves to a JSHandle of the success value

This method behaves differently with respect to the type of the first parameter:
- if `selectorOrFunctionOrTimeout` is a `string`, then the first argument is treated as a [selector] or [xpath], depending on whether or not it starts with '//', and the method is a shortcut for
  [page.waitForSelector](#pagewaitforselectorselector-options) or [page.waitForXPath](#pagewaitforxpathxpath-options)
- if `selectorOrFunctionOrTimeout` is a `function`, then the first argument is treated as a predicate to wait for and the method is a shortcut for [page.waitForFunction()](#pagewaitforfunctionpagefunction-options-args).
- if `selectorOrFunctionOrTimeout` is a `number`, then the first argument is treated as a timeout in milliseconds and the method returns a promise which resolves after the timeout
- otherwise, an exception is thrown

Shortcut for [page.mainFrame().waitFor(selectorOrFunctionOrTimeout[, options[, ...args]])](#framewaitforselectororfunctionortimeout-options-args).

#### page.waitForFunction(pageFunction[, options[, ...args]])
- `pageFunction` <[function]|[string]> Function to be evaluated in browser context
- `options` <[Object]> Optional waiting parameters
  - `polling` <[string]|[number]> An interval at which the `pageFunction` is executed, defaults to `raf`. If `polling` is a number, then it is treated as an interval in milliseconds at which the function would be executed. If `polling` is a string, then it can be one of the following values:
    - `raf` - to constantly execute `pageFunction` in `requestAnimationFrame` callback. This is the tightest polling mode which is suitable to observe styling changes.
    - `mutation` - to execute `pageFunction` on every DOM mutation.
  - `timeout` <[number]> maximum time to wait for in milliseconds. Defaults to `30000` (30 seconds).
- `...args` <...[Serializable]|[JSHandle]> Arguments to pass to  `pageFunction`
- returns: <[Promise]<[JSHandle]>> Promise which resolves when the `pageFunction` returns a truthy value. It resolves to a JSHandle of the truthy value.

The `waitForFunction` can be used to observe viewport size change:
```js
const puppeteer = require('puppeteer');

puppeteer.launch().then(async browser => {
  const page = await browser.newPage();
  const watchDog = page.waitForFunction('window.innerWidth < 100');
  page.setViewport({width: 50, height: 50});
  await watchDog;
  await browser.close();
});
```
Shortcut for [page.mainFrame().waitForFunction(pageFunction[, options[, ...args]])](#framewaitforfunctionpagefunction-options-args).

#### page.waitForNavigation(options)
- `options` <[Object]> Navigation parameters which might have the following properties:
  - `timeout` <[number]> Maximum navigation time in milliseconds, defaults to 30 seconds, pass `0` to disable timeout. The default value can be changed by using the [page.setDefaultNavigationTimeout(timeout)](#pagesetdefaultnavigationtimeouttimeout) method.
  - `waitUntil` <[string]|[Array]<[string]>> When to consider navigation succeeded, defaults to `load`. Given an array of event strings, navigation is considered to be successful after all events have been fired. Events can be either:
    - `load` - consider navigation to be finished when the `load` event is fired.
    - `domcontentloaded` - consider navigation to be finished when the `DOMContentLoaded` event is fired.
    - `networkidle0` - consider navigation to be finished when there are no more than 0 network connections for at least `500` ms.
    - `networkidle2` - consider navigation to be finished when there are no more than 2 network connections for at least `500` ms.
- returns: <[Promise]<[Response]>> Promise which resolves to the main resource response. In case of multiple redirects, the navigation will resolve with the response of the last redirect.

#### page.waitForSelector(selector[, options])
- `selector` <[string]> A [selector] of an element to wait for,
- `options` <[Object]> Optional waiting parameters
  - `visible` <[boolean]> wait for element to be present in DOM and to be visible, i.e. to not have `display: none` or `visibility: hidden` CSS properties. Defaults to `false`.
  - `hidden` <[boolean]> wait for element to not be found in the DOM or to be hidden, i.e. have `display: none` or `visibility: hidden` CSS properties. Defaults to `false`.
  - `timeout` <[number]> maximum time to wait for in milliseconds. Defaults to `30000` (30 seconds).
- returns: <[Promise]<[ElementHandle]>> Promise which resolves when element specified by selector string is added to DOM.

Wait for the `selector` to appear in page. If at the moment of calling
the method the `selector` already exists, the method will return
immediately. If the selector doesn't appear after the `timeout` milliseconds of waiting, the function will throw.

This method works across navigations:
```js
const puppeteer = require('puppeteer');

puppeteer.launch().then(async browser => {
  const page = await browser.newPage();
  let currentURL;
  page
    .waitForSelector('img')
    .then(() => console.log('First URL with image: ' + currentURL));
  for (currentURL of ['https://example.com', 'https://google.com', 'https://bbc.com'])
    await page.goto(currentURL);
  await browser.close();
});
```
Shortcut for [page.mainFrame().waitForSelector(selector[, options])](#framewaitforselectorselector-options).

#### page.waitForXPath(xpath[, options])
- `xpath` <[string]> A [xpath] of an element to wait for,
- `options` <[Object]> Optional waiting parameters
  - `visible` <[boolean]> wait for element to be present in DOM and to be visible, i.e. to not have `display: none` or `visibility: hidden` CSS properties. Defaults to `false`.
  - `hidden` <[boolean]> wait for element to not be found in the DOM or to be hidden, i.e. have `display: none` or `visibility: hidden` CSS properties. Defaults to `false`.
  - `timeout` <[number]> maximum time to wait for in milliseconds. Defaults to `30000` (30 seconds).
- returns: <[Promise]<[ElementHandle]>> Promise which resolves when element specified by xpath string is added to DOM.

Wait for the `xpath` to appear in page. If at the moment of calling
the method the `xpath` already exists, the method will return
immediately. If the xpath doesn't appear after the `timeout` milliseconds of waiting, the function will throw.

This method works across navigations:
```js
const puppeteer = require('puppeteer');

puppeteer.launch().then(async browser => {
  const page = await browser.newPage();
  let currentURL;
  page
    .waitForXPath('//img')
    .then(() => console.log('First URL with image: ' + currentURL));
  for (currentURL of ['https://example.com', 'https://google.com', 'https://bbc.com'])
    await page.goto(currentURL);
  await browser.close();
});
```
Shortcut for [page.mainFrame().waitForXPath(xpath[, options])](#framewaitforxpathxpath-options).


### class: Keyboard

Keyboard provides an api for managing a virtual keyboard. The high level api is [`keyboard.type`](#keyboardtypetext-options), which takes raw characters and generates proper keydown, keypress/input, and keyup events on your page.

For finer control, you can use [`keyboard.down`](#keyboarddownkey-options), [`keyboard.up`](#keyboardupkey), and [`keyboard.sendCharacter`](#keyboardsendcharacterchar) to manually fire events as if they were generated from a real keyboard.

An example of holding down `Shift` in order to select and delete some text:
```js
await page.keyboard.type('Hello World!');
await page.keyboard.press('ArrowLeft');

await page.keyboard.down('Shift');
for (let i = 0; i < ' World'.length; i++)
  await page.keyboard.press('ArrowLeft');
await page.keyboard.up('Shift');

await page.keyboard.press('Backspace');
// Result text will end up saying 'Hello!'
```

An example of pressing `A`
```js
await page.keyboard.down('Shift');
await page.keyboard.press('KeyA');
await page.keyboard.up('Shift');
```

> **NOTE** On MacOS, keyboard shortcuts like `⌘ A` -> Select All do not work. See [#1313](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer/issues/1313)

#### keyboard.press(key[, options])
- `key` <[string]> Name of key to press, such as `ArrowLeft`. See [USKeyboardLayout] for a list of all key names.
- `options` <[Object]>
  - `text` <[string]> If specified, generates an input event with this text.
  - `delay` <[number]> Time to wait between `keydown` and `keyup` in milliseconds. Defaults to 0.
- returns: <[Promise]>

If `key` is a single character and no modifier keys besides `Shift` are being held down, a `keypress`/`input` event will also generated. The `text` option can be specified to force an input event to be generated.

> **NOTE** Modifier keys DO effect `elementHandle.press`. Holding down `Shift` will type the text in upper case.

Shortcut for [`keyboard.down`](#keyboarddownkey-options) and [`keyboard.up`](#keyboardupkey).

#### keyboard.sendCharacter(char)
- `char` <[string]> Character to send into the page.
- returns: <[Promise]>

Dispatches a `keypress` and `input` event. This does not send a `keydown` or `keyup` event.

```js
page.keyboard.sendCharacter('嗨');
```

> **NOTE** Modifier keys DO NOT effect `keyboard.sendCharacter`. Holding down `Shift` will not type the text in upper case.

#### keyboard.type(text, options)
- `text` <[string]> A text to type into a focused element.
- `options` <[Object]>
  - `delay` <[number]> Time to wait between key presses in milliseconds. Defaults to 0.
- returns: <[Promise]>

Sends a `keydown`, `keypress`/`input`, and `keyup` event for each character in the text.

To press a special key, like `Control` or `ArrowDown`, use [`keyboard.press`](#keyboardpresskey-options).

```js
page.keyboard.type('Hello'); // Types instantly
page.keyboard.type('World', {delay: 100}); // Types slower, like a user
```

> **NOTE** Modifier keys DO NOT effect `keyboard.type`. Holding down `Shift` will not type the text in upper case.

#### keyboard.up(key)
- `key` <[string]> Name of key to release, such as `ArrowLeft`. See [USKeyboardLayout] for a list of all key names.
- returns: <[Promise]>

Dispatches a `keyup` event.

- `options` <[Object]> Optional waiting parameters
- `...args` <...[Serializable]|[JSHandle]> Arguments to pass to  `pageFunction`
- returns: <[Promise]<[JSHandle]>> Promise which resolves to a JSHandle of the success value

This method behaves differently with respect to the type of the first parameter:
- if `selectorOrFunctionOrTimeout` is a `string`, then the first argument is treated as a [selector] or [xpath], depending on whether or not it starts with '//', and the method is a shortcut for
  [frame.waitForSelector](#framewaitforselectorselector-options) or [frame.waitForXPath](#framewaitforsxpathxpath-options)
- if `selectorOrFunctionOrTimeout` is a `function`, then the first argument is treated as a predicate to wait for and the method is a shortcut for [frame.waitForFunction()](#framewaitforfunctionpagefunction-options-args).
- if `selectorOrFunctionOrTimeout` is a `number`, then the first argument is treated as a timeout in milliseconds and the method returns a promise which resolves after the timeout
- otherwise, an exception is thrown


#### frame.waitForFunction(pageFunction[, options[, ...args]])
- `pageFunction` <[function]|[string]> Function to be evaluated in browser context
- `options` <[Object]> Optional waiting parameters
  - `polling` <[string]|[number]> An interval at which the `pageFunction` is executed, defaults to `raf`. If `polling` is a number, then it is treated as an interval in milliseconds at which the function would be executed. If `polling` is a string, then it can be one of the following values:
    - `raf` - to constantly execute `pageFunction` in `requestAnimationFrame` callback. This is the tightest polling mode which is suitable to observe styling changes.

- returns: <[Promise]<[JSHandle]>> Promise which resolves when the `pageFunction` returns a truthy value. It resolves to a JSHandle of the truthy value.

The `waitForFunction` can be used to observe viewport size change:
```js
const puppeteer = require('puppeteer');

puppeteer.launch().then(async browser => {
  const page = await browser.newPage();
  const watchDog = page.mainFrame().waitForFunction('window.innerWidth < 100');
  page.setViewport({width: 50, height: 50});
  await watchDog;

- returns: <[Promise]<[ElementHandle]>> Promise which resolves when element specified by selector string is added to DOM.

Wait for the `selector` to appear in page. If at the moment of calling
the method the `selector` already exists, the method will return
immediately. If the selector doesn't appear after the `timeout` milliseconds of waiting, the function will throw.

This method works across navigations:
```js

  const page = await browser.newPage();
  let currentURL;
  page.mainFrame()
    .waitForSelector('img')
    .then(() => console.log('First URL with image: ' + currentURL));
  for (currentURL of ['https://example.com', 'https://google.com', 'https://bbc.com'])
    await page.goto(currentURL);
  await browser.close();
});
```

#### frame.waitForXPath(xpath[, options])
- `xpath` <[string]> A [xpath] of an element to wait for
- `options` <[Object]> Optional waiting parameters
  - `visible` <[boolean]> wait for element to be present in DOM and to be visible, i.e. to not have `display: none` or `visibility: hidden` CSS properties. Defaults to `false`.
  - `hidden` <[boolean]> wait for element to not be found in the DOM or to be hidden, i.e. have `display: none` or `visibility: hidden` CSS properties. Defaults to `false`.
  - `timeout` <[number]> maximum time to wait for in milliseconds. Defaults to `30000` (30 seconds).
- returns: <[Promise]<[ElementHandle]>> Promise which resolves when element specified by xpath string is added to DOM.

Wait for the `xpath` to appear in page. If at the moment of calling
the method the `xpath` already exists, the method will return
immediately. If the xpath doesn't appear after the `timeout` milliseconds of waiting, the function will throw.

This method works across navigations:
```js
const puppeteer = require('puppeteer');

puppeteer.launch().then(async browser => {
  const page = await browser.newPage();
  let currentURL;
  page.mainFrame()
    .waitForXPath('//img')
    .then(() => console.log('First URL with image: ' + currentURL));
  for (currentURL of ['https://example.com', 'https://google.com', 'https://bbc.com'])
    await page.goto(currentURL);
  await browser.close();
});
```

### class: JSHandle

JSHandle represents an in-page JavaScript object. JSHandles can be created with the [page.evaluateHandle](#pageevaluatehandlepagefunction-args) method.

```js
const windowHandle = await page.evaluateHandle(() => window);
// ...
```

JSHandle prevents references JavaScript objects from garbage collection unless the handle is [disposed](#jshandledispose). JSHandles are auto-disposed when their origin frame gets navigated or the parent context gets destroyed.

JSHandle instances can be used as arguments in [`page.$eval()`](#pageevalselector-pagefunction-args), [`page.evaluate()`](#pageevaluatepagefunction-args) and [`page.evaluateHandle`](#pageevaluatehandlepagefunction-args) methods.

#### jsHandle.asElement()
- returns: <?[ElementHandle]>

Returns either `null` or the object handle itself, if the object handle is an instance of [ElementHandle].

#### jsHandle.dispose()
- returns: <[Promise]> Promise which resolves when the object handle is successfully disposed.

The `jsHandle.dispose` method stops referencing the element handle.

#### jsHandle.executionContext()
- returns: [ExecutionContext]

Returns execution context the handle belongs to.

#### jsHandle.getProperties()
- returns: <[Promise]<[Map]<[string], [JSHandle]>>>

The method returns a map with property names as keys and JSHandle instances for the property values.

```js
const handle = await page.evaluateHandle(() => ({window, document}));
const properties = await handle.getProperties();
const windowHandle = properties.get('window');
const documentHandle = properties.get('document');
await handle.dispose();
```

#### jsHandle.getProperty(propertyName)
- `propertyName` <[string]> property to get
- returns: <[Promise]<[JSHandle]>>

Fetches a single property from the referenced object.

#### jsHandle.jsonValue()
- returns: <[Promise]<[Object]>>

Returns a JSON representation of the object. If the object has a
[`toJSON`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON/stringify#toJSON()_behavior)
function, it **will not be called**.

> **NOTE** The method will return an empty JSON if the referenced object is not stringifiable. It will throw an error if the object has circular references.

### class: ElementHandle

> **NOTE** Class [ElementHandle] extends [JSHandle].

ElementHandle represents an in-page DOM element. ElementHandles can be created with the [page.$](#pageselector) method.

```js
const puppeteer = require('puppeteer');

puppeteer.launch().then(async browser => {
  const page = await browser.newPage();
  await page.goto('https://google.com');
  const inputElement = await page.$('input[type=submit]');
  await inputElement.click();
  // ...
});
```

ElementHandle prevents DOM element from garbage collection unless the handle is [disposed](#elementhandledispose). ElementHandles are auto-disposed when their origin frame gets navigated.

ElementHandle instances can be used as arguments in [`page.$eval()`](#pageevalselector-pagefunction-args) and [`page.evaluate()`](#pageevaluatepagefunction-args) methods.

#### elementHandle.$(selector)
- `selector` <[string]> A [selector] to query element for
- returns: <[Promise]<?[ElementHandle]>>

The method runs `element.querySelector` within the page. If no element matches the selector, the return value resolve to `null`.

#### elementHandle.$$(selector)
- `selector` <[string]> A [selector] to query element for
- returns: <[Promise]<[Array]<[ElementHandle]>>>

The method runs `element.querySelectorAll` within the page. If no elements match the selector, the return value resolve to `[]`.

#### elementHandle.$x(expression)
- `expression` <[string]> Expression to [evaluate](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/evaluate).
- returns: <[Promise]<?[ElementHandle]>> Promise which resolves to ElementHandle pointing to the frame element.

The method evaluates the XPath expression relative to the elementHandle. If there's no such element, the method will resolve to `null`.

#### elementHandle.asElement()
- returns: <[elementhandle]>

#### elementHandle.boundingBox()
- returns: <[Promise]<?[Object]>>
    - x <[number]> the x coordinate of the element in pixels.
    - y <[number]> the y coordinate of the element in pixels.
    - width <[number]> the width of the element in pixels.
    - height <[number]> the height of the element in pixels.

This method returns the bounding box of the element (relative to the main frame), or `null` if the element is not visible.

#### elementHandle.getProperties()
- returns: <[Promise]<[Map]<[string], [JSHandle]>>>

The method returns a map with property names as keys and JSHandle instances for the property values.

```js
const listHandle = await page.evaluateHandle(() => document.body.children);
const properties = await listHandle.getProperties();
const children = [];
for (const property of properties.values()) {
  const element = property.asElement();
  if (element)
    children.push(element);
}
children; // holds elementHandles to all children of document.body
```

#### elementHandle.getProperty(propertyName)
- `propertyName` <[string]> property to get
- returns: <[Promise]<[JSHandle]>>

Fetches a single property from the objectHandle.

#### elementHandle.jsonValue()
- returns: <[Promise]<[Object]>>

Returns a JSON representation of the object. The JSON is generated by running [`JSON.stringify`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON/stringify) on the object in page and consequent [`JSON.parse`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON/parse) in puppeteer.

> **NOTE** The method will throw if the referenced object is not stringifiable.

#### elementHandle.press(key[, options])
- `key` <[string]> Name of key to press, such as `ArrowLeft`. See [USKeyboardLayout] for a list of all key names.
- `options` <[Object]>
  - `text` <[string]> If specified, generates an input event with this text.
  - `delay` <[number]> Time to wait between `keydown` and `keyup` in milliseconds. Defaults to 0.
- returns: <[Promise]>

Focuses the element, and then uses [`keyboard.down`](#keyboarddownkey-options) and [`keyboard.up`](#keyboardupkey).

If `key` is a single character and no modifier keys besides `Shift` are being held down, a `keypress`/`input` event will also be generated. The `text` option can be specified to force an input event to be generated.

> **NOTE** Modifier keys DO effect `elementHandle.press`. Holding down `Shift` will type the text in upper case.

#### elementHandle.toString()
- returns: <[string]>

#### elementHandle.type(text[, options])
- `text` <[string]> A text to type into a focused element.
- `options` <[Object]>
  - `delay` <[number]> Time to wait between key presses in milliseconds. Defaults to 0.
- returns: <[Promise]>

Focuses the element, and then sends a `keydown`, `keypress`/`input`, and `keyup` event for each character in the text.

To press a special key, like `Control` or `ArrowDown`, use [`elementHandle.press`](#elementhandlepresskey-options).

```js
elementHandle.type('Hello'); // Types instantly
elementHandle.type('World', {delay: 100}); // Types slower, like a user
```

An example of typing into a text field and then submitting the form:
```js
const elementHandle = await page.$('input');
await elementHandle.type('some text');
await elementHandle.press('Enter');
```

#### elementHandle.uploadFile(...filePaths)
- `...filePaths` <...[string]> Sets the value of the file input these paths. If some of the  `filePaths` are relative paths, then they are resolved relative to [current working directory](https://nodejs.org/api/process.html#process_process_cwd).
- returns: <[Promise]>

This method expects `elementHandle` to point to an [input element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input).

### class: Request

Whenever the page sends a request, the following events are emitted by puppeteer's page:
- ['request'](#event-request) emitted when the request is issued by the page.
- ['response'](#event-response) emitted when/if the response is received for the request.
- ['requestfinished'](#event-requestfinished) emitted when the response body is downloaded and the request is complete.

If request fails at some point, then instead of 'requestfinished' event (and possibly instead of 'response' event), the  ['requestfailed'](#event-requestfailed) event is emitted.

If request gets a 'redirect' response, the request is successfully finished with the 'requestfinished' event, and a new request is  issued to a redirected url.

#### request.abort([errorCode])
- `errorCode` <[string]> Optional error code. Defaults to `failed`, could be
  one of the following:
  - `aborted` - An operation was aborted (due to user action)
  - `accessdenied` - Permission to access a resource, other than the network, was denied
  - `addressunreachable` - The IP address is unreachable. This usually means
    that there is no route to the specified host or network.
  - `connectionaborted` - A connection timed out as a result of not receiving an ACK for data sent.
  - `connectionclosed` - A connection was closed (corresponding to a TCP FIN).
  - `connectionfailed` - A connection attempt failed.
  - `connectionrefused` - A connection attempt was refused.
  - `connectionreset` - A connection was reset (corresponding to a TCP RST).
  - `internetdisconnected` - The Internet connection has been lost.
  - `namenotresolved` - The host name could not be resolved.
  - `timedout` - An operation timed out.
  - `failed` - A generic failure occurred.
- returns: <[Promise]>

Aborts request. To use this, request interception should be enabled with `page.setRequestInterception`.
Exception is immediately thrown if the request interception is not enabled.

#### request.continue([overrides])
- `overrides` <[Object]> Optional request overwrites, which can be one of the following:
  - `url` <[string]> If set, the request url will be changed
  - `method` <[string]> If set changes the request method (e.g. `GET` or `POST`)
  - `postData` <[string]> If set changes the post data of request
  - `headers` <[Object]> If set changes the request HTTP headers
- returns: <[Promise]>

Continues request with optional request overrides. To use this, request interception should be enabled with `page.setRequestInterception`.
Exception is immediately thrown if the request interception is not enabled.

#### request.failure()
- returns: <?[Object]> Object describing request failure, if any
  - `errorText` <[string]> Human-readable error message, e.g. `'net::ERR_FAILED'`.

The method returns `null` unless this request was failed, as reported by
`requestfailed` event.

Example of logging all failed requests:

```js
page.on('requestfailed', request => {
  console.log(request.url() + ' ' + request.failure().errorText);
});
```

#### request.frame()
- returns: <?[Frame]> A matching [Frame] object, or `null` if navigating to error pages.

#### request.headers()
- returns: <[Object]> An object with HTTP headers associated with the request. All header names are lower-case.

#### request.method()
- returns: <[string]> Request's method (GET, POST, etc.)

#### request.postData()
- returns: <[string]> Request's post body, if any.

#### request.resourceType()
- returns: <[string]>

Contains the request's resource type as it was perceived by the rendering engine.
ResourceType will be one of the following: `document`, `stylesheet`, `image`, `media`, `font`, `script`, `texttrack`, `xhr`, `fetch`, `eventsource`, `websocket`, `manifest`, `other`.

#### request.respond(response)
- `response` <[Object]> Response that will fulfill this request
  - `status` <[number]> Response status code, defaults to `200`.
  - `headers` <[Object]> Optional response headers
  - `contentType` <[string]> If set, equals to setting `Content-Type` response header
  - `body` <[Buffer]|[string]> Optional response body
- returns: <[Promise]>

Fulfills request with given response. To use this, request interception should
be enabled with `page.setRequestInterception`. Exception is thrown if
request interception is not enabled.

An example of fulfilling all requests with 404 responses:

```js
await page.setRequestInterception(true);
page.on('request', request => {
  request.respond({
    status: 404,
    contentType: 'text/plain',
    body: 'Not Found!'
  });
});
```

> **NOTE** Mocking responses for dataURL requests is not supported.
> Calling `request.respond` for a dataURL request is a noop.

#### request.response()
- returns: <?[Response]> A matching [Response] object, or `null` if the response has not been received yet.

#### request.url()
